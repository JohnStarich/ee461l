## Motivation

### Problem
There's no easy way to find movies groups of people want to watch. Our audience doesn't have a good way to choose movies they'd like to see, especially not with groups with various preferences.

### Target Audience
We're aiming for an audience of 18-25 year olds. Generally speaking, anyone interested in seeing movies with others.

### Demand
Users want to see movies they're interested in with other people. This website would enable them to reach out to their friends with our service and organize a trip to the movies. Based on the users' preferences, the site would provide a list of optimal choices for movies that a group of friends could watch together.

### Vision
We see this project becoming a large social hub for people to find and watch movies they want to see. Later we may decide to add user ratings and trend data for user movie preferences.

## Features and Requirements

### User Stories

1. Users can register and enter their movie preferences and watched movies.
2. Users can link up with their friends and generate a "Top 5" list of movies that they will most likely enjoy together. 
3. Users can subscribe for weekly updates on new upcoming movie releases.
4. Users will receive notifications based on new movies coming out and what their friends are up to.
